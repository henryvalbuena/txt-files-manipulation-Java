# Read / Write a txt file with Java

I have used this program to create a base class to use a txt file as a data base,
(until I get to the part where I can set up my own database :smile:)
However, it can be used simply to edit files, by just setting the write parameters:

**1. writeToFile()** where we can specify how we will write in the file
**2. subclass Format()** which will set the minimum parameters to consider if you need a specific structure in your file.

The last one is used in this program to only capture the information required by the program. In this case we use a booking
system for hotels. But it can be used for other things.

:v:
